## Summary
This project explores the impact of discounts on product sales performance for Eniac, with a focus on understanding when and how discounts help or hurt business outcomes.

The goal was to identify the relationship between discount levels and sales volume, analyze the behavior of cheap vs. premium products, and examine seasonal trends like Black Friday and Christmas.

The findings revealed that most products are sold with discounts below 25%, and that discounts tend to boost sales of cheaper products. Seasonal campaigns also showed strong spikes in performance, confirming the importance of timing and targeted marketing strategies.
